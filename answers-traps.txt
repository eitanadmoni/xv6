Which registers contain arguments to functions? - a0-a7 and fa0-fa7

For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf? - a2

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)- in the line   
li	a1,12

At what address is the function printf located? - in 0000000000000630

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main? - 38



Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? - He110 World;

The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? - 0x6C640000
Would you need to change 57616 to a different value? no


In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) - a garbage value
Why does this happen? - because we don't put second parameter to printf

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
